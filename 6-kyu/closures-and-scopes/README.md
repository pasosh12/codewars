<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/526ec46d6f5e255e150002d1/train/javascript target="_blank">Closures and Scopes</a></h2><h3>6 kyu</h3><p>We want to create a function, which returns an array of functions, which return their index in the array. For better understanding, here an example:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-def">callbacks</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-variable">createFunctions</span>(<span class="cm-number">5</span>); <span class="cm-comment">// create an array, containing 5 functions</span><span class="cm-variable">callbacks</span>[<span class="cm-number">0</span>](); <span class="cm-comment">// must return 0</span><span class="cm-variable">callbacks</span>[<span class="cm-number">3</span>](); <span class="cm-comment">// must return 3</span></code></pre><p>We already implemented that function, but when we actually run the code, the result doesn't look like what we expected. Can you spot, what's wrong with it? A test fixture is also available</p>
